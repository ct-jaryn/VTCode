original — it is the authority; this file is only VT Code's working notes.

## Why this matters to VT Code

VT Code executes untrusted model-directed commands. The article's core thesis
is that in-process checks are insufficient and the privilege boundary must be
a process boundary enforced by the kernel, with privileges that only ever
decrease. That is exactly the shape of VT Code's Linux launcher
(`vtcode sandbox-exec`: Landlock filesystem rules + seccomp syscall filtering
+ `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`) and the reason hostname allowlists and macOS Seatbelt
domain filtering fail closed instead of degrading silently.

## Distilled principles (in our own words)

1. **Sandboxing = discretionary privilege dropping.** Three parts: done
   programmatically by the application, without needing administrator rights,
   and only ever reducing privileges — never raising them.
2. **Complement, don't replace, sysadmin policy.** Filesystem permissions and
   container tools are the administrator's layer; application sandboxing sits
   on top of it.
3. **No superuser helpers for sandboxing.** Setuid helpers and user namespaces
   widen kernel attack surface; namespaces belong to trusted container tools,
   not to per-command sandboxing.
4. **The boundary is the process.** Credentials live at process granularity;
   thread-level schemes do not survive contact with real kernels and libc.
5. **Compartmentalized programs are distributed programs.** One process per
   compartment, communicating by message passing; the broker owns every grant
   and workers never hand capabilities to each other.
6. **File descriptors behave like capabilities — except `ioctl`.** Permission
   is checked at creation, not at use, so passing an FD grants its rights;
   `ioctl` requests are the exception and must be filtered individually.
7. **Capsicum is the ideal to imitate.** One call that disables ambient
   authority, fine-grained rights reduction per FD, and directory-relative
   resolution that cannot escape beneath the granted root.
8. **On Linux the answer is Landlock + seccomp.** Allow `open` and constrain
   it with Landlock rather than interposing libc; use seccomp as hardening
   around the edges, not as the policy engine.
9. **Blocklists are fragile.** New syscalls, per-architecture numbering, and
   the x32 ABI alias bit all bypass naive deny-lists; duplicate blocked
   numbers across ABIs and kill mismatched architectures outright.
10. **Deny the `/proc/self/fd` reopen.** If a child can reopen its own FDs by
    path with a different mode, FDs stop being capabilities. Keep `/proc` and
    `/sys` ungranted and never grant `/dev` wholesale (`/dev/fd` aliases the
    same escape).
11. **Broker hygiene for received output.** Non-blocking reads, bounded
    buffers, bounded close/drain — a sandboxed child must not be able to hang
    or exhaust the broker.
12. **Interrogate the threat model.** Sandboxing code you already trust with
    the data may be pointless; sandboxing code that handles attacker data
    (parsers, renderers, decompressors) is where it pays.

## Short attributed quotations

> "Compartmentalised application development is, of necessity, distributed

> — Watson, Anderson, Laurie & Kennaway, *Capsicum: practical capabilities
> for UNIX*, as quoted in the article.

> "Seccomp is not a good mechanism for discretionary privilege dropping.
> Seccomp is a good mechanism for OS hardening."

> "If you can learn just 3 functions, you can code for the actor model:
> `spawn_vm`, `send`, `receive`."

## How VT Code applies it

| Principle | VT Code location | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Only-decrease (`NO_NEW_PRIVS`) | `sandboxing/linux_seccomp.rs::apply_seccomp_filter` | Enforced |
| No namespaces as sandbox | `NAMESPACE_CLONE_FLAGS` + `clone3`→`ENOSYS` | Enforced |
| Process boundary | `sandbox-exec` launcher, `child_spawn.rs` | Enforced |
| Broker/worker tree, no FD forwarding | `sandboxing/mod.rs` docs, `manager.rs` | Convention |
| FDs as capabilities, `ioctl` filtered | `TIOCSTI`/`TIOCSCTTY` seccomp rules; Landlock `IoctlDev` unhandled for PTY | Enforced |
| Blocklist + x32 aliases + arch kill | `BLOCKED_SYSCALLS`, `X32_SYSCALL_BIT`, seccompiler arch validation | Enforced |
| `/proc`/`/sys` ungranted, `/dev` restricted | `VIRTUAL_FS_ROOTS`, `restrict_dev_grants` | Enforced |
| Hostname allowlists fail closed | `manager.rs`, `linux.rs`, `security.md` | Enforced |
| Reusable policy families + version | `SECCOMP_PROFILE_VERSION`, Kafel-family comments | Convention |
| `LD_PRELOAD`/libc interposition broker | — | Deliberately not adopted |
| Full whitelist rewrite | — | Future work, not started |

## Deliberately not adopted

- **`LD_PRELOAD` / `libc_service` brokering** for legacy binaries: complexity
  outweighs coverage while Landlock handles our command set.
- **Namespace-based isolation**: reserved for trusted container tools.
- **Kafel DSL import**: family labels and versioning adopted; the language
  itself not vendored.

## For the coding agent

Consult this file before touching `sandboxing/`, `child_spawn.rs`,
`exec_env.rs`, or `manager.rs`. Preserve the fail-closed direction on every
edit: an unknown syscall, path, or architecture must deny, never allow. Keep
`syscall_number` in sync with `BLOCKED_SYSCALLS`, keep
`SECCOMP_PROFILE_VERSION` bumped with blocklist edits, and keep this table
accurate. Run `cargo nextest run -p vtcode-safety` plus the Linux cross check
documented in the crate's history before claiming done.
