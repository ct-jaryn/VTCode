# Diff Preview Architecture

VT Code computes text changes in the publishable `vtcode-diff` crate. The crate
has no dependency on other VT Code crates: it owns bounded `similar`-based diff
computation, the semantic document model, intraline byte ranges, Unicode-width
wrapping, unified/side-by-side layout, and bounded excerpts.

Application crates own policy and presentation:

- `vtcode-ui` caches the document when an overlay opens and only relayouts or
  scrolls it during resize and navigation.
- theme and terminal capability selection remain in the VT Code design system;
  diff styling uses a subtle full-row add/delete tint and a stronger
  background for changed intraline spans. Context rows remain un-tinted,
  while hunk and file metadata use bold syntax-highlighted foregrounds with no
  background. ANSI16 terminals and explicit no-color output fall back to
  foreground-only styling.
- syntax highlighting is injectable application work, so the reusable crate
  does not depend on `syntect` or VT Code themes.
- approval state, modal priority, `Enter`/`Esc` behavior, and runtime events are
  unchanged and remain outside the diff crate.

`DiffOptions` defaults to practical Myers with separate line and intraline
timeouts. Patience and Histogram are public library choices but are not config
values. For large output, preserve readable semantic rows and disable costly
refinement before suppressing content. `LayoutOptions::max_rows` produces a
head/tail excerpt with an explicit omission row.

The user-facing unified layout is still configured as `"inline"` for backward
compatibility. Width decisions use the measured content width after message
indentation and transcript framing: side-by-side falls back to unified below
the shared 60-column threshold, and either unified presentation hides its
visible `+`/`-`, line-number, and `│` gutter when keeping it would leave less
than 20 columns for source text. The gutter and side-by-side panes return
automatically when a resize restores enough width. Tests should cover
asymmetric insert/delete cases, UTF-8 boundaries, display-width wrapping,
deadlines, pairing, exact omission accounting, and both sides of these width
boundaries.

## Turn aggregation, event fields, and themes

- `TurnDiffTracker` (`vtcode-core`) aggregates per-file changes within a turn.
  `get_unified_diff` output is deterministic (entries sorted by path) and
  bounded: entries whose stored content exceeds 200 000 bytes render as a
  one-line summary instead of a full diff.
- The `ThreadEvent::FileChange` payload (`FileChangeItem` in
  `vtcode-exec-events`) carries optional `unified_diff`, `additions`, and
  `deletions` fields. They are populated from the tracker so consumers can
  render per-change previews without recomputation; older events without the
  fields deserialize unchanged, and the fields are omitted from output when
  unset.
- `vtcode-diff` skips intraline refinement when any line contains a NUL byte
  (binary content), preserving line-level diffs without paying the word-level
  cost. CRLF terminators, missing-final-newline hints, and git-compatible
  zero-context hunk headers (`@@ -0,0 +1,N @@`) are covered by regression
  tests.
- Hunk headers keep their authored range counts. Previews render
  `@@ -65,19 +65,0 @@` verbatim (and `display_lines_from_hunks` synthesizes the
  same git-compatible form via `format_hunk_header`); collapsing to the
  start-only `@@ -65 +65 @@` is rejected because it misreports a multi-line or
  pure-deletion hunk as a one-line change.
- Diff syntax highlighting reconstructs each side (pre-image and post-image)
  in original file order and highlights it once, bounded by the existing
  byte/line caps, so parser state survives hunk boundaries (multi-line strings
  and comments split across hunks stay correctly highlighted). Oversized
  content falls back to per-hunk highlighting.
- Selectable diff themes live in `vtcode-ui`'s design layer
  (`DiffTheme`: github, ayu, gruvbox, nord, solarized, dracula). Every accent
  in every theme is contrast-checked against its background at WCAG AA
  4.5:1 by `every_theme_meets_wcag_aa_contrast`. Use
  `format_colored_diff_with_theme` for themed rendering; the default theme
  keeps the canonical `format_colored_diff` colors.
- The overlay header truncates the file path so the action label and
  `(+N -N)` counts remain visible at any width.

## Readability: wrap and expand

User-facing behavior for long diffs in the TUI:

- **Transcript wrap** — when tool output renders into the inline TUI sink,
  edit/patch body rows are word-wrapped instead of ellipsis-truncated, up to a
  2 000-cell safety cap (`DIFF_WRAP_SOURCE_MAX_WIDTH` in
  `src/agent/runloop/tool_output/streams.rs`). Continuation rows hang under the
  visible gutter or, for compact tinted rows without a gutter, under the single
  marker cell. CLI / no-sink renders keep the bounded `MAX_LINE_LENGTH` cap.
- **Vertical omission** — expandable `review full diff` copy and `DiffReviewAnchor`
  are recorded only when the renderer still holds the **complete** unified body
  and clipped it for display (inline TUI sink, not a pre-truncated registry
  excerpt). Tool-level truncated previews advertise omission/excerpt copy and
  never claim full-diff review. CLI/no-sink keeps the actionable
  `exec_command`/sed recovery hint.
- **Safety-cap expand** — when an inline-TUI body row exceeds
  `DIFF_WRAP_SOURCE_MAX_WIDTH`, the transcript still ellipsis-truncates that
  row but also advertises expand (`… diff truncated — review full diff for
  <path>`) and records a `DiffReviewAnchor` with the retained unified payload.
- **Review overlay** — approval/conflict/readonly-review overlays use the full
  viewport. Layout keeps `LayoutOptions.wrap = true`; long lines wrap inside
  the overlay. When laid-out **wrapped** rows exceed content height the
  controls footer shows `+N more`. Completed-edit review can open from a
  retained unified preview via `DiffOverlayRequest { unified: Some(...), mode: ReadonlyReview }`
  / `DiffPreviewState::from_unified`.

Spec: `docs/compose/spec/tui-diff-auto-expand.md`.

The presentation architecture was informed by the open-source
[Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) terminal diff design (Apache-2.0).
VT Code's implementation and state model remain independent; no Codex source
code was copied.
