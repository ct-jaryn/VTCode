# Configuration reset and live reload

This guide describes the implementation contract for configuration changes made while VT Code is running.

## Shared reset service

`vtcode_core::config::ConfigService::reset` is the single reset path for the CLI and settings palette. It resolves the
selected layer through the current `ConfigDefaultsProvider`, validates an optional explicit path against known layers,
rejects symlinks and non-regular files, writes an empty TOML document atomically, invalidates the workspace cache, and
reloads the effective layer stack. It never touches credential storage.

The CLI maps `vtcode config reset` to the workspace layer, `--global` to the canonical user layer, and `--project` to
the current project profile. An explicit `--config path` selects the workspace-layer file for that invocation. Reset
remains command-owned during startup so a malformed configuration can be repaired without provider authentication or
model initialization.

## Runtime reload contract

`SimpleConfigWatcher` polls every configuration path that can affect a workspace, including the explicit session file,
system/user paths, project profiles, workspace fallback/root files, and the theme file. It retains nonexistent paths so
creation and deletion are observable. Reload errors are recorded separately from the last valid snapshot and must be
surfaced as a warning without replacing that snapshot.

The unified interaction loop applies valid snapshots through the workspace reload helper. Runtime identity fields
selected by CLI/session state remain stable; safe UI, policy, timeout, MCP, and custom-provider changes are applied to
the active runtime. The open settings palette reloads its draft through the same layer stack and restores its remembered
section/selection.

The settings palette persists a mutation as a field-level update to the selected file instead of serializing the merged
effective snapshot. This preserves lower-precedence layers: for example, a user custom provider is not written into a
workspace `vtcode.toml` when a workspace-only setting changes. Provider definitions and endpoint/credential overrides
are written to the canonical user layer unless the session selected an explicit config file.

## Settings palette navigation

The `/config` root intentionally contains only the seven curated task-oriented groups, Advanced settings, Reload
configuration, and Reset configuration. Curated groups expose common fields with stable ordering and concise counts.
Advanced settings keeps complete generated-schema coverage in a flat, search-first view; its search index includes
paths, labels, descriptions, current values, and options. Direct nested paths remain supported so links and
slash-command workflows do not lose access to uncommon or provider-specific settings.

### Visual hierarchy and feedback

Setting rows render **title + accent value + dimmed description**. The live value lives in `InlineListItem::value`
(never packed into the subtitle), and badges carry a semantic `InlineTone`:

| Badge                             | Tone              | Meaning            |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| `On` / `Off`                      | Success / Neutral | Boolean state      |
| `Pick` / `Edit` / `Step` / `List` | Accent            | Interaction kind   |
| `Destructive`                     | Danger            | Reset confirmation |
| `Cancel` / `Back`                 | Neutral           | Safe exit          |

Nested views start with a `← Back` row. `Esc` backs out of a nested view and closes the palette at root. The reset
confirmation defaults selection to **Keep settings**.

Every apply/save/cancel sets an in-modal **status strip** (`InlineStatus` with Success / Warning / Danger / Accent tone)
that persists while the palette is open, and emits one short chat line (`Settings: …`) for the durable record. The
keyboard footer is `Navigation: ↑/↓ select • Enter/Space apply • ←/→ change value • type to filter • Esc back/close`.

The model picker (`/model`) follows the same presentation contract: step progress in the header (`Step 1 · Model`),
provider section headers, a `Current` badge (`InlineTone::Current`) on the active model, capability metadata as dimmed
subtitle text, and a completion chat line of the form `Model: {provider}/{model} · reasoning {level} · tier {tier}`.

Normal startup and live reload also use a repair-capable loader for legacy repository files. If an otherwise parseable
workspace or project file still contains protected provider definitions or endpoint/credential overrides from an older
flattened write, only those fields are removed atomically and the configuration is loaded again. Malformed or symlinked
files remain errors, and explicitly selected config files are never repaired.

Planning-mode policy changes are repository writes too: entering or leaving Planning mode must persist only the
tool-policy fields in the workspace layer. The shared repository-safe writer removes trusted custom providers and
provider endpoint/credential overrides, including stale copies left by older releases.

## Verification

Use nextest for focused checks:

```bash
cargo nextest run --locked -p vtcode-config
cargo nextest run --locked -p vtcode-core -E 'test(/reset|settings_reload|selection_memory/)'
RUSTFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo check --locked --tests -p vtcode-config -p vtcode-core -p vtcode
```

Reset and reload tests must cover layer preservation, cache invalidation, explicit paths, symlink/non-regular-file
rejection, malformed edits, creation/deletion, debounce behavior, and selection restoration.
