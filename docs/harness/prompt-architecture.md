# Prompt Architecture

## Cache-stable segments

Each harness segment freezes one `SessionRequestEnvelope`: a segment ID, the
system prompt, a canonically ordered tool catalog, and the instruction digest.
Ordinary turns only append messages. Compaction or a change to the catalog
epoch, primary agent, model, provider, mode, or instruction digest starts a new
segment and therefore one intentional cache miss.

Session-start time is rendered once into the cached system prompt. Later time
must come from tool output. Approval and sandbox policy values are execution
gateway state and must not be rendered into prompts or tool descriptions.

VT Code's prompt system follows the four pillars of *Section 18.3 (Prompt
Architecture)* of the agentic-AI guide:

1. **System-prompt design** (18.3.1) — persona, capabilities, constraints,
   universal runtime guidance, and output format assembled once per segment.
2. **Dynamic assembly** (18.3.2) — modular, cache-friendly composition at
   segment creation from the base prompt, instruction appendix, runtime
   contract, recovery mode, harness limits, tool catalog, and primary-agent
   state. Later runtime changes are appended as context messages.
3. **Few-shot management** (18.3.3) — keyword-tagged examples loaded from
   disk, token-budgeted via `vtcode_commons::tokens::estimate_tokens`,
   and appended as a synthetic system context message when relevant; they do
   not rewrite the immutable prompt prefix.
4. **Tool descriptions** (18.3.4) — every LLM-visible tool must include
   when-to-use guidance, when-NOT-to-use guidance, and a constraints cue
   (rate-limit, max size, side-effect, permission). The
   `tool_descriptions_satisfy_documented_contract` test in
   `crates/codegen/vtcode-core/src/tools/registry/builtins.rs::tests` enforces this
   contract at `cargo test` time.

## Assembly order

At segment creation, `request_builder::build_prompt_output` produces the
immutable `system_prompt` in this order:

1. **Base system prompt** — `vtcode_core::prompts::system::generate_system_instruction`
   (with `Default / Minimal / Lightweight / Specialized` variants cached
   via `OnceLock`). Each cached profile includes the deterministic compiled
   runtime-guidance section from `prompts/runtime_guidance.rs` exactly once.
2. **INSTRUCTIONS** appendix — `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and other
   project-scoped instruction files discovered by
   `project_doc::build_instruction_appendix_with_context`.
3. **Runtime mode contract** — full-auto / planning / request_user_input
   flags (`runtime_contract::append_runtime_mode_sections`).
4. **Auto-permission notice** — only when `auto_permission && !planning`.
5. **Active Primary Agent Skills** — when a primary agent is active.
6. **Harness Limits** — `harness_limits::upsert_harness_limits_section`.
7. **Recovery Mode** — when `tool_free_recovery` is active; tools are
   stripped from the catalog snapshot.
8. **Runtime Tool Catalog** — `append_runtime_tool_prompt_sections` with
   the planning/capability filtered `SessionToolCatalogSnapshot`.
9. **GitHub Copilot Client Tools** — only for the Copilot provider.
10. **Active Primary Agent Runtime State** — model, reasoning effort,
    instructions, and `### Memory Appendix` if the agent has memory.
11. **[Few-Shot Examples]** — never part of the system prompt. When
    relevant and budget allows, the block is persisted in history once per
    user turn, directly after the user message (see below).

## Prompt style

The compiled base prompt (`prompts/system.rs`, `prompts/runtime_guidance.rs`,
`prompts/guidelines.rs`) is written to work unchanged on every provider,
including small local models.

- **Plain prose with reasons.** State each rule as a full sentence and give
  the reason when it is not obvious ("confirm destructive actions ... since
  lost work may be unrecoverable"). Do not use capitalized emphasis such as
  MUST, NEVER, or CRITICAL; the runtime-guidance test rejects it.
- **One home per rule.** Universal rules (scope, grounding, verification
  honesty, delegation, safety, tool-failure recovery, waiting on
  `next_wait_args` instead of polling, `spool_path` paging and
  `preview_budget_exhausted` handling, progress updates) live only in
  `RUNTIME_GUIDANCE_SECTION`, which every profile includes and which is
  re-added when a workspace `system.md` replaces the base. State the
  harness carries across compaction lives in `SHARED_CONTRACT_LINES`.
  Extended style for the Default, Lightweight, and Specialized profiles
  lives in `DEFAULT_SPECIFIC_LINES`. Operating deltas describe only mode
  mechanics (core tools, Planning workflow, tracker). Per-tool mechanics,
  including the single `start_planning` line, live in the `## Active Tools`
  section from `prompts/guidelines.rs`, and `[Harness Limits]` states limit
  values, their exemptions, and how to work within each limit; neither
  restates a universal rule.
  `static_prompts::tests::shared_contract_lines_and_runtime_bullets_appear_exactly_once_per_profile`
  asserts that every `SHARED_CONTRACT_LINES` entry, every profile-specific
  contract line, and every Runtime Guidance bullet appears exactly once in
  each profile, and
  `guidelines::tests::universal_rules_have_one_home_across_composed_prompt_sections`
  composes each profile with the Default, Minimal, and Planning tool
  guidance plus Harness Limits and asserts each universal rule appears
  exactly once.
- **Provider-agnostic.** No model or provider names, no references to
  provider-specific features such as thinking blocks or context-clearing
  parameters, and no formatting that depends on one vendor's renderer.
- **Budgets with justification.** Each profile and section has a token or
  character bound in its tests. When a bound is raised, the constant or
  assertion carries a one-line comment saying why and what it measured.
  Current base sizes (cl100k estimate): Minimal about 525, Lightweight about
  730, Default about 860, Specialized about 875, Runtime Guidance about 440.

## Few-shot management (Section 18.3.3)

### Authoring examples

Examples live as Markdown files under:

- `<workspace>/.vtcode/prompts/examples/*.md`
- `<canonical user config directory>/prompts/examples/*.md` (legacy user prompt files are migrated there)

The filename stem is the example id. The file body uses YAML frontmatter
for metadata:

```markdown
---
id: read-then-edit-large-file
tags: [read, edit, patch, large-file, refactor]
summary: Inspect a large file in targeted shell slices before editing; use apply_patch for multi-hunk changes.
---
# User
<the user query>

# Assistant
<the expected tool sequence and rationale>
```

`tags` and `summary` are optional. `tags` drive the keyword selector;
`summary` is appended to the prompt as a one-line caption above the
body. Workspace examples take precedence over user-global examples on id
collision.

### Selection

For each turn, the harness:

1. Reads the most recent user message and uses it as the selection
   query.
2. Loads the example store from disk via `FewShotStore::load`.
3. Scores each example: +1.0 per exact tag/word match, +0.5 per tag that
   appears as a substring of the query.
4. Sorts by score desc, then id asc (stable ordering).
5. Walks in order, appending until the running total exceeds
   [`DEFAULT_FEW_SHOT_BUDGET_TOKENS`] (default 800 tokens, ~10% of an 8K
   context window).
6. Renders the chosen examples as a `[Few-Shot Examples]` block and, at
   the first request of the turn only, persists it in canonical history
   directly after the user message
   (`llm_request/request_context.rs`). Every later request of the turn, and
   every later turn, replays it unchanged at that position, so requests stay
   append-only for prompt caching and for models that bind replayed thinking
   to the exact prior prefix (Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Fable 5.1).
7. Shapes the persisted block per route: routes with turn-scoped system
   messages send it as `role: "system"` with
   `clear_at: "next_user_message"`, so it stops applying once the next user
   turn arrives; other routes receive it as a user-role context message,
   because their adapters fold mid-history system messages into the
   top-level system prompt and would rewrite the cached system prefix
   whenever the selection changes. Earlier turns' blocks stay in history
   (bounded by the per-turn budget) until compaction removes them.

The selection is keyword-based and runs in-process without an embedding
provider. Embedding-based selection is the documented next step (see
Section 18.3.3); layering it on top will not require API changes.

### Guard rails

- **Recovery mode skips few-shot.** When `tool_free_recovery` is active
  the model is in "summarize from evidence" mode and adding examples
  would distract. The few-shot block is omitted.
- **Empty stores are silent.** If no examples are present, no
  `[Few-Shot Examples]` block is added — no overhead for users who don't
  ship examples.
- **Token count is honest.** `FewShotExample::token_count` is computed
  via the `cl100k_base` BPE tokenizer in
  `vtcode_commons::tokens::estimate_tokens`. Budget enforcement uses the
  same tokenizer, so the budget is accurate for OpenAI models and
  within ~10% for Anthropic / Gemini.

### Adding a new example

1. Choose a stable, hyphenated id (used in logs and prompts).
2. Author the `.md` file with frontmatter and body.
3. Run `cargo test -p vtcode-core prompts::few_shot::tests` to confirm
   the example loads and selects correctly.
4. Optional: add a `FewShotStore::from_examples(...)` unit test that
   asserts the example is selected by a representative query.

## Tool description contract (Section 18.3.4)

Every LLM-visible tool whose description is not in the allowlist must
include:

- A **verb cue** — `Use `, `Create `, `List `, `Fetch `, etc. — so the
  model recognizes the action the tool performs.
- A **constraint cue** — e.g. `max ...`, `rate-limit`, `session`,
  `timeout`, `requires approval`, `inherits` — so the model knows the
  limits and side effects. Prohibition phrasing such as `Do NOT ...` or
  `Avoid ...` does not satisfy the rule; models that follow tool
  descriptions literally over-apply it, so state the concrete limit instead.

Descriptions must be 40-1500 characters. Tools exempted from the constraint
requirement are single-action or read-only helpers (`request_user_input`,
`search_tools`, `code_search`, etc.) where the model can safely call them
without explicit guard-rails. The allowlist holds registration names only;
aliases such as `cron_list` are never checked. See the test for the full
allowlist and cue vocabulary.

Run `cargo test -p vtcode-core tools::registry::builtins::tests::tool_descriptions_satisfy_documented_contract`
to validate any description change before merging.
