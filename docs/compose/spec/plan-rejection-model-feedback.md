# Plan Rejection Must Reach Model History

## Report

**What was built** — Terminal plan-artifact rejections now put validator-owned
feedback into model-visible assistant history, not only the TUI. On
`PlanArtifactError::Invalid`, history receives `PlanValidationReport::repair_feedback()`
(missing sections, invalid steps, empty summary/validation/assumptions, plus the
canonical `Action -> files: […] -> verify: […]` form and concrete verify
examples). Non-Invalid errors use their Display text. Both terminal surfaces
share `plan_rejection_history_feedback`, so execution-mode (stable
`EXECUTION_PLAN_REJECTION_NOTICE` prefix + feedback) and planning-active
terminal rejection cannot diverge. Repair-scheduled paths are unchanged.

This fixes the session-vtcode-20260924T133543Z_155288-07964 failure mode: the
TUI showed `Plan revision rejected: invalid plan artifact: missing sections: …`
while history only had a generic sentence, so a later user `continue`
resubmitted the same invalid `**Goal:**` plan and the agent claimed “no specific
reason given”.

**Verification**
- `./scripts/check-dev.sh` — PASS
- `cargo nextest run -p vtcode -E '(test(reject) or test(execution_mode) or test(plan_rejection) or test(plan_only_execution) or test(repair_directive) or test(plan_mode) or test(planning_workflow) or test(tool_free) or test(untagged_planlike)) and not test(from_validated_debug_asserts_on_non_ready_report)'` — PASS (281)
- PRE-EXISTING (also fail on clean base `8101b4e51`): `from_validated_debug_asserts_on_non_ready_report`, `planning_preview_budget_keeps_midsize_payload_exec_strips_it` (SIGABRT debug-assert tests)

**Journey log**
- The rejection text in the repro matches the execution-mode terminal renderer
  (`Plan revision rejected` + `Rejected plan revision:`), not the planning
  terminal wording — that path was publishing a fixed notice without `{error}`.
- `repair_feedback()` is the right history payload: `reasons()` can echo raw
  `open_decisions` lines; `repair_feedback()` stays validator-owned.
- Two `test(plan)` nextest filters over-matched provider/updater tests and
  unrelated auth failures; scope filters to the vtcode binary test names.
- Review pass collapsed four copy-pasted history assertions into
  `last_final_answer_text` + `assert_history_carries_validator_feedback`, and
  both terminal surfaces into `terminal_plan_rejection_message`.

## [S1] Problem

When a `<proposed_plan>` fails plan-artifact validation, the TUI shows the full
validator reasons (`Plan revision rejected: invalid plan artifact: missing
sections: …`) but the model-visible assistant history does not. Session
`session-vtcode-20260924T133543Z_155288-07964` reproduced this: the agent
resubmitted the same invalid `**Goal:**` / `**Scope of edits:**` plan twice and
reported "rejected … with no specific reason given", then asked the user to
approve a draft the validator had already rejected.

Root cause: the execution-mode terminal path publishes
`EXECUTION_PLAN_REJECTION_NOTICE` (a fixed string with no validation detail) via
`handle_assistant_response`. Only the renderer line carries `{error}`. A later
user `continue` therefore has the rejected draft but not the contract it
violated.

The planning-active terminal path includes `{error}` Display text, but not the
canonical step format / verify examples the repair directive already owns.

## [S2] Design

### S2.1 Model-visible rejection contract

Every **terminal** plan rejection (no repair scheduled) must put the following
into the assistant final-response history, not only the renderer:

1. The existing user-facing rejection sentence (so TUI and history stay aligned).
2. Validator-owned feedback from `PlanValidationReport::repair_feedback()` for
   `PlanArtifactError::Invalid` (missing sections, invalid steps, empty summary /
   validation / assumptions, plus canonical `Action -> files: […] -> verify: […]`
   and concrete verify examples). For other error variants, the error Display.
3. The rejected draft remains appended via `append_rejected_plan_draft_to_last_assistant`
   (unchanged).

Repair-scheduled paths already push `plan_repair_directive_for_error` and are
unchanged.

### S2.2 Shared helper

One helper builds the history feedback for both terminal surfaces:

- execution-mode (`EXECUTION_PLAN_REJECTION_NOTICE` + feedback)
- planning-active terminal ("Revise the plan…" sentence + feedback)

so the two paths cannot diverge. `EXECUTION_PLAN_REJECTION_NOTICE` stays a
stable prefix constant so existing tests and log greps keep working.

### S2.3 Out of scope

- Changing validator rules or required headings.
- Increasing `MAX_PLAN_VALIDATION_REPAIR_REPROMPTS`.
- Prompt-text changes in compiled planning guidance (already document the format).
- The README work from the repro session (already landed on main).

## [S3] Out of Scope

See S2.3. No `ThreadEvent` contract change; the extra text is assistant-message
content only.

## Tasks

- [x] T1: Add shared rejection-feedback helper and use it on both terminal reject paths — acceptance: execution-mode and planning terminal `handle_assistant_response` text includes validator repair feedback (covers: S2.1, S2.2)
- [x] T2: Regression tests — acceptance: tests assert final assistant history contains validation reasons (e.g. "missing required section") and canonical step format after terminal rejection; existing `EXECUTION_PLAN_REJECTION_NOTICE` prefix checks still pass (covers: S2.1; depends: T1)
