# Instant TUI Startup

## Report

**What was built** — Interactive first paint no longer waits on legacy path
migration, harness session-store retention, or the terminal palette probe.
`bootstrap_main` loads `.env` on the critical path but defers
`migrate_legacy_global_paths` to `spawn_blocking` for interactive launches
(non-interactive consumers still migrate synchronously).
`initialize_harness` now only opens the canonical emitter; retention and legacy
log pruning run in `run_harness_retention`, spawned after `initialize_session_ui`. The palette probe
is never awaited before TUI spawn (`note_crossterm_raw_mode` makes a late
`RawModeGuard` restore a no-op; `await_terminal_palette_probe` drains after
spawn; timeout 50 ms). iTerm2 icon ensure is
`spawn_blocking`. Theme/palette still settle before the first model turn;
hydration contracts are unchanged.

**Verification**
- `./scripts/check-dev.sh` — PASS (also fixed pre-existing vtcode-ui clippy `let_and_return` / `float_cmp` and a test `unreachable!`)
- Targeted `cargo nextest run -p vtcode` (hydrate / bootstrap / startup_policy / harness / migration deferral) — PASS (17–18 tests)
- Release PTY first-frame (isolated HOME, `--provider ollama --model llama3`): pre-change median **472.8 ms** → post-change **~360–410 ms** (samples in `.vtcode/perf/post-change-*.json`)
- Large-store (120-session copy) first-frame: pre-change **2214 ms** with `dotenv_and_migration=1707 ms` spike → post-change **~375 ms**, `dotenv_and_migration≈0.1 ms`
- Residual: warm first-frame still ~360–410 ms (target 150 ms not met). Dominated by `session_setup_critical` ~175–220 ms (`ToolRegistry` + `discover_controller_subagents`) plus UI spawn. Artifacts: `.vtcode/perf/pre-change-*.json`, `.vtcode/perf/post-change-*.json`, `.vtcode/perf/post-change-final-*.json`

**Journey log**
- The user-visible “launch takes forever” regression was the large-store `migrate_legacy` spike (1.7 s), not the 2026-09-18 hydrate split itself.
- Harness retention before `initialize_session_ui` was silent paint-path I/O; splitting emitter vs retention was the highest-leverage structural fix.
- Palette probe: overlapping it with critical init still serialized on a silent PTY; only “don’t wait before spawn + make RawModeGuard restore cooperative” removed the paint-path gate (timeout now 50 ms).
- `session_setup_critical` remains the floor until a registry-light paint path exists (previous journey already named this follow-up).
- Concurrency during measurement (parallel cargo) once produced a fake 1.2 s `session_setup_critical`; always measure on an idle machine.

## [S1] Problem

Interactive first-frame latency regressed after the 2026-09-18 critical/hydrate
split. Measured on the shipped 0.169.2 release binary with `VTCODE_STARTUP_TRACE=1`
(isolated HOME + ollama/llama3, and again against the real HOME/workspace):

| Case | first_ui_render | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Isolated clean HOME | 382–550 ms | median ~420 ms |
| Real HOME + vtcode workspace | 414–449 ms | session_setup_critical 146–155 ms |
| Copied large session store (120 sessions) | up to **2214 ms** | `dotenv_and_migration` spike **1707 ms** |
| Standalone `--version` / `--help` | 5–6 ms | no regression |
| Standalone `schema tools` | 42 ms | no regression |

The previous delivery reported ~468 ms warm first-frame. Current warm first-frame
is similar or worse on clean machines and **much worse** when `.vtcode` has
accumulated sessions. Users experience this as “launch takes a long time.”

Phase decomposition (real env run):

- `bootstrap` ≈ 11 ms
- `session_setup_critical` ≈ 150 ms
- `session_setup_ui` ≈ 6 ms (only when probe replies quickly)
- `first_ui_render` ≈ 414–547 ms total wall from process start

So roughly **250–350 ms is untraced work before first paint**, plus an
occasional multi-second `dotenv_and_migration` stall. The prior design’s
hydration split is still in place; the regression is work that was added to or
left on the paint path around it.

Bottlenecks (ordered by measured impact):

1. **`dotenv_and_migration` / `VtCodePaths::migrate_legacy`** (`src/main.rs`
   `migrate_legacy_global_paths`) runs synchronously in `bootstrap_main` before
   dispatch. `LegacyMigrator::run` always touches the marker, parent dir, and
   may scan/copy legacy trees. Observed spike: **1707 ms** with a large store
   present. Even the fast path is serial with everything else before the agent
   loop.
2. **Terminal palette probe await** (`src/agent/agents.rs` calls
   `await_terminal_palette_probe()` at the top of `run_single_agent_loop`).
   The probe itself has a **200 ms** timeout (`terminal_color_probe.rs`). It is
   started early, but bootstrap is only ~12–18 ms, so the await commonly still
   pays most of the 200 ms before any session setup. This is a large slice of
   the untraced gap.
3. **`initialize_harness` sits between critical init and UI spawn**
   (`session_loop_runner/orchestration.rs` then `harness.rs`). It runs
   `prune_old_harness_logs` + `vtcode_memory::apply_retention_preserving`
   (walks every session dir, may `rmtree` dozens of sessions) **before**
   `initialize_session_ui`. With 120+ sessions this is real disk I/O on the
   paint path.
4. **`session_setup_critical` still ~140–155 ms** — `ToolRegistry::new*` +
   `discover_controller_subagents` remain on the critical path (known follow-up
   from the previous delivery).
5. **Session archive setup before paint** — `reserve_session_archive_identifier`
   / `create_session_archive` / `checkpoint_session_archive_start` run before
   `initialize_session_critical`.

## [S2] Design

User-approved goals (carried forward):

1. **Acceptance metric** — interactive first-frame latency (warm, release).
2. **Scope** — runtime path only; no cargo feature-gating of heavy crates.
3. **Readiness model** — minimal UI first, then ready; first model turn waits
   for hydration.

New target for this amendment: **warm interactive first-frame ≤ 150 ms** on an
isolated clean HOME (and no worse than ~250 ms with a large session store),
without changing ThreadEvent / safety / product-surface contracts.

### Contracts

- Hydration failures still abort before a model turn.
- After hydration, tool surface / skills / system prompt / primary agent / MCP /
  permissions match prior post-setup behavior.
- Standalone `--version` / `--help` / `schema tools` must not regress.
- Opt-in trace phases remain: `session_setup_critical`, `session_setup_ui`,
  `session_setup_hydrate`, `session_setup`, `first_ui_render`. New optional
  sub-phases are allowed if they stay opt-in and silent when unset.
- Retention / legacy migration / harness log pruning are **maintenance**, not
  first-paint prerequisites. They may run after first paint or in background.
- The palette probe must not serialize before first paint when the terminal
  is slow to answer (timeout reduced to 50 ms; never awaited before TUI spawn).
  Termios race with crossterm must still be avoided via `note_crossterm_raw_mode`.

### Paint-path split (this amendment)

1. **Before first frame (hard minimum)**
   - CLI + dotenv (without legacy migration)
   - Config load + provider client
   - Lightweight `ToolRegistry` + one primary-agent discovery
   - Resume history + cheap bootstrap
   - Seed system prompt + execution-context shells
   - Minimal harness/event emitter **without** retention sweeps
   - TUI spawn / first paint
2. **After first frame, before first model turn (hydration)**
   - Existing deferred hydration (unchanged)
   - Harness retention (`apply_retention_preserving`) + legacy harness-log prune
   - Legacy path migration (or fire-and-forget after paint)
   - Palette probe result application (theme can re-drive after probe)
3. **Background / async allowed**
   - Update preflight (already spawned)
   - Temp-spool cleanup (already spawned)
   - iTerm2 icon ensure (move off the inline pre-TUI path if it still blocks)

### Out of scope

- Feature-gating heavy crates out of the default binary.
- Release profile / LTO / allocator changes.
- Provider network latency and first-run onboarding UX redesign.
- Changing `ThreadEvent` or tool safety policy semantics.
- Binary size / dyld work.

## Tasks

- [x] T1: Record pre-change warm first-frame baselines (isolated + large-store) with `VTCODE_STARTUP_TRACE` — acceptance: phase timings saved under `.vtcode/perf/` (covers: S1)
- [x] T2: Move legacy path migration off the interactive first-paint path — acceptance: `dotenv_and_migration` no longer includes multi-hundred-ms `migrate_legacy` work on interactive launch; migration still runs and stays idempotent (covers: S1, S2)
- [x] T3: Stop blocking session setup on the 200 ms palette probe — acceptance: first-frame no longer waits the probe timeout when the terminal is silent; theme/palette still correct after probe completes; no termios race (covers: S1, S2)
- [x] T4: Move harness retention + legacy log prune after first paint — acceptance: `initialize_harness` before `initialize_session_ui` does not walk/prune the session store; retention still applies before the first model turn (covers: S1, S2)
- [x] T5: Slim remaining `session_setup_critical` if T2–T4 leave first-frame above target — acceptance: warm isolated first-frame ≤ 150 ms, **or documented residual with evidence** (covers: S2; depends: T2, T3, T4) — residual: warm first-frame ~360–410 ms, dominated by `session_setup_critical` ~175–220 ms (ToolRegistry + plugin-aware discovery still required before paint per S2) + UI spawn; 150 ms target not met without a registry-light paint path
- [x] T6: Update `docs/development/performance.md` (and binary gotchas if needed) for the new paint-path rules — acceptance: docs describe migration/retention/palette deferral (covers: S2; depends: T2, T3, T4)
- [x] T7: Verify + re-measure — acceptance: `./scripts/check-dev.sh` and targeted nextest PASS; before/after first-frame recorded in Report (covers: S2; depends: T2, T3, T4, T5, T6)
