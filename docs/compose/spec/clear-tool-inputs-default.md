# Clear Tool Inputs by Default

## Report

**What was built** — `agent.harness.tool_result_clearing.clear_tool_inputs` now defaults to `true`, so request-only clearing stubs paired `tool_calls[].function.arguments` (and freeform `text`) together with the old tool results it already reclaimed. Edit-heavy sessions no longer re-pay full `apply_patch` patch bodies and `write_file` file bodies on every request after the result stub landed. Explicit `clear_tool_inputs = false` remains the opt-out. A named serde default fn (`default_tool_result_clearing_clear_tool_inputs`) makes missing TOML keys follow the same path as `Default` — bare `#[serde(default)]` on a `bool` would have silently kept `false`. The same config field feeds Anthropic native `clear_tool_uses` wire edits, so that payload now sends `clear_tool_inputs: true` as well. Durable history and `vtcode-exec-events::ThreadEvent` are unchanged.

**Verification** — `./scripts/check-dev.sh` PASS. `cargo nextest run -p vtcode-config -E 'test(tool_result_clearing)'` 5/5 PASS. `cargo nextest run -p vtcode-core -E 'test(clear_old_tool) or test(tool_result_clearing)'` 10/10 PASS (includes `clear_old_tool_results_default_config_clears_paired_inputs`). `cargo nextest run -p vtcode -E 'test(request_builder) or test(clear_tool_uses) or test(local_tool_result)'` 31/31 PASS. `cargo nextest run -p vtcode-config --lib` 453/453 PASS. `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo check --locked -p vtcode-config -p vtcode-core -p vtcode` PASS. Independent review: approve (5/5 AC, 0 critical/high).

**Journey log**
- Bare `#[serde(default)]` on a `bool` field is `false`, not the struct `Default` — the default fn must be named on the field or missing TOML keys silently keep the old behavior.
- `clear_tool_inputs` is shared by local `clear_old_tool_results` and Anthropic native `clear_tool_uses`; a default flip moves both pins (`request_builder.rs` context_management expectation).
- CONFIG_FIELD_REFERENCE.md is generator-sourced but routinely hand-edited (~119 lines of pre-existing drift); matching the rustdoc prose keeps a future regen stable.

## [S1] Problem

`agent.harness.tool_result_clearing` stubs old tool *results* past
`trigger_tokens` (default 40k / keep 2), but `clear_tool_inputs` defaulted to
`false`. Assistant `tool_calls[].function.arguments` therefore kept every
historical `apply_patch` patch body and `write_file` file body on every request
after the paired result was already stubbed.

Edit-heavy coding sessions paid this cost twice: the result was reclaimed, but
the model's own pasted patch/file content — often the largest string in the
transcript — rode every subsequent request until late compaction. This was the
largest remaining first-class token leak in the local-clearing path.

## [S2] Design

Settled: flip the default so input clearing follows result clearing. Keep the
opt-out. Do not change the clearing contract.

### S2-default: `clear_tool_inputs` defaults to true

- In `vtcode-config`, `ToolResultClearingConfig::default()` sets
  `clear_tool_inputs: true`.
- Missing TOML keys follow the same default: the serde field uses
  `#[serde(default = "default_tool_result_clearing_clear_tool_inputs")]`
  returning `true` (bare `#[serde(default)]` on a `bool` is `false` and would
  silently keep the leak).
- Explicit `clear_tool_inputs = false` remains a supported opt-out.
- No change to `clear_old_tool_results` semantics: inputs are replaced only for
  call ids whose paired results were stubbed, with the existing valid-JSON
  placeholder `{"cleared":"tool_input"}`. Tool name stays on
  `call.function.name`. Freeform `text` and `thought_signature` are cleared the
  same way as today.
- Anthropic mutual exclusion unchanged: local clearing (results + inputs) runs
  only when the wire will not carry native `clear_tool_uses`. When native
  edits are used, the same config field feeds the wire
  `clear_tool_uses_20250919` edit (`clear_tool_inputs: true`).
- Durable history and `vtcode-exec-events::ThreadEvent` remain untouched
  (request-only shaping).

### S2-docs: state the new default

- `docs/config/CONFIG_FIELD_REFERENCE.md`: default `false` → `true`.
- `docs/development/EXECUTION_POLICY.md` tool-result-clearing bullet: note that
  paired tool *inputs* are cleared by default as well.

## [S3] Out of Scope

- Changing `trigger_tokens` / `keep_tool_uses` / `clear_at_least_tokens`.
- Compaction thresholds or compaction prompts.
- Wire-level Anthropic `clear_tool_uses` behavior beyond the default value.
- Placeholder shape changes or path-preserving input stubs.
- Startup warning text beyond what already covers disabled clearing.

## Tasks

- [x] T1: default `clear_tool_inputs` to true (struct Default + serde default fn) — acceptance: `ToolResultClearingConfig::default().clear_tool_inputs` is true; a TOML harness config that omits the key also yields true; explicit `false` still parses (covers: S2-default)
- [x] T2: update pin tests + docs — acceptance: `test_tool_result_clearing_defaults` asserts true; CONFIG_FIELD_REFERENCE and EXECUTION_POLICY show the new default (covers: S2-docs; depends: T1)
- [x] T3: regression that cleared results clear paired inputs by default — acceptance: `clear_old_tool_results` with default-on config replaces arguments for stubbed call ids and leaves kept calls intact (covers: S2-default; depends: T1)
