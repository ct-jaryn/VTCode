# Harness Textual Tool-Call Harden

## Report

**What was built** — Content-derived tool-call extraction no longer treats fenced
documentation or mid-prose tag mentions as executable calls. The tagged
`tool_call` scanner (main harness `text_tools::parse_tagged` and skill
`parse_textual_skill_tool_call`) only binds clean identifier names outside
fenced code blocks, skips dirty candidates, and keeps gateway preamble+call
shapes working. Native tool calls canonicalize shell aliases (`bash`/`shell`/
`run`/…) to `exec_command` and reject prose-blob names at prepare time, so
fixture payloads cannot dispatch under a garbage name. Skill sub-LLM parsing
gains the same fence + clean-name gate plus an injection regression.

**Verification** — `./scripts/check-dev.sh` PASS; `./scripts/check-dev.sh --test`
154/155 (one failure `print_mode_requires_prompt_or_stdin` is PRE-EXISTING:
missing OpenAI auth in this environment). Focused nextest: `text_tools` +
`prepared_tool_call` 109/109 PASS; `textual_skill` + `skill_executor` +
`is_clean_skill` + pty reap 30/30 PASS.

**Journey log** —
- Session logs showed tool names that were whole prose blobs ending in
  `exec_command` and fixture `bash`/`rm -rf /` calls; root cause was tagged
  markup search with no fence/identifier gate, not streaming name pollution.
- Existing tests intentionally parse fenced Rust/YAML function-style blocks, so
  fence exclusion is scoped to the tagged `tool_call` dialect only.
- `unfenced_byte_ranges` must not search the fenced body when handling the
  closer line (first skill-side draft did; fixed before tests).
- Silent-star remainder: session-ID uniqueness holds (`create_session` rejects
  duplicates); Windows `kill_process_group` still untested (documented on
  `reap_child_bounded`); read-guard keeps scoped block (no broad recovery);
  first-paint registry defers policy until `ensure` (no dispatch race found).
- Self-review (subagent stalled/cancelled) caught three criticals before ship:
  (1) `canonicalize_shell_tool_alias` was collapsing PTY tools into
  `exec_command`; (2) strict `is_clean_tool_name` on native calls would reject
  MCP names with `::`; (3) skill parser lost the empty-payload `return None`.
  All three fixed + regression tests (`shell_alias_maps_only_true_shell_names`,
  `dispatchable_tool_name_allows_mcp_and_rejects_prose`).

## [S1] Problem

Session `session-vtcode-20260925T141131Z_691914-40628` (model `zai/glm-5.3-flash`)
collapsed after six turns (8.1M input tokens) while implementing a plan to harden
skill textual tool-call parsing. Observed in `events.jsonl`:

1. **Prose-embedded markup became tools.** Model text that merely *discussed*
   `tool_call` tags was parsed into tool invocations whose `tool_name` was a
   garbage prose blob ending in `exec_command` (preflight: `Unknown tool: ...`).
2. **Documentation examples were attempted as real calls.** Test fixtures the
   model wrote (`bash` + `rm -rf /`, `rm -rf /tmp/demo`, `git push --force`) were
   extracted as tool invocations. `bash` failed as unknown (luck, not design);
   a clean `exec_command` name would have executed the fixture payload.
3. **Recovery cascade aborted the turn.** After bogus calls: tools disabled →
   `Recovery synthesis failed; no tool call applied` → `turn.blocked`
   (`blocked_streak: 4`) → `turn aborted`.

Root cause class: content-derived tool-call extraction (`text_tools` and
`skills/executor.rs::parse_textual_skill_tool_call`) matches `tool_call` anywhere
in model text — including fenced documentation and mid-prose mentions — and
dispatches the result without a clean-name check. Native alias names (`bash`,
`shell`, `run`) are not canonicalized before registry dispatch, so the same
fixture can be either unknown or executable depending on which path parses it.

The broken session's approved plan (`.vtcode/plans/1790345671722-silent-star.md`)
also left unfished remediation items (exec-session close lock, session-id
uniqueness, Windows process-group kill, planning read-guard decision,
registry-first-paint race).

## [S2] Design

### A. Main-harness textual tool-call policy (`src/agent/runloop/text_tools/`)

**Fences.** Markup inside fenced code blocks (``` or ~~~, CommonMark-ish: opener
allows an info string; closer is 3+ of the same fence char with only whitespace)
is documentation and is never executable. `detect_textual_tool_call` and
`strip_textual_tool_call_regions` only consider unfenced byte ranges.

**Clean call.** Outside fences, a tagged `tool_call` is converted only when the
parsed tool name is a clean identifier (`[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*`, length ≤ 64)
and the call has a complete payload (arg tags, JSON object, or key=value pairs).
Mid-prose mentions such as `` `tool_call` `` yield an empty/invalid name and are
skipped; the scan continues to the next candidate. If no clean call exists, the
response stays text.

**Native names.** Registry dispatch canonicalizes known shell aliases
(`bash`, `shell`, `exec`, `run`, `run_cmd`, …) to `exec_command` for *native*
tool calls as well (same map the textual path already uses), so a model-emitted
`bash` runs as `exec_command` instead of `Unknown tool: bash`. Names that are
not clean identifiers (spaces, newlines, length > 64) are rejected at preflight
as invalid, not dispatched.

### B. Recovery cascade

Bogus textual extractions that fail name/payload validation no longer become
tool calls at all (they stay text under A), so they cannot trip the tools-disabled
fuse or the recovery contract-violation path. When a tool-free recovery pass
still sees tool-call markup, existing strip + one retry directive remains;
`Recovery synthesis failed` must not fire solely because the model quoted markup
in its synthesis text.

### C. Skill sub-LLM (`crates/codegen/vtcode-core/src/skills/executor.rs`)

`parse_textual_skill_tool_call` adopts the same fence exclusion and clean-name
requirement. Alias mapping (`canonicalize_skill_textual_tool_name`) stays for
real calls but cannot fire on fenced or non-identifier names. Regression:
provider content that embeds markup inside a fence (or as a quoted example with
a non-identifier name) must not execute and must fall through to final content;
the existing out-of-scope denial regression still passes.

### D. Remaining silent-star plan items

1. **Injection regression** in `skills/executor.rs` (covers C).
2. **Narrow/sole-content** — delivered by A/C clean-call + fence rules (no
   alias-list shrink required once non-identifiers cannot bind).
3. **`output_read_lock` close race** — regression in `exec_session.rs`: a pipe
   reader holding `output_read_lock` past `EXEC_SESSION_OUTPUT_READ_LOCK_TIMEOUT`
   must fail cleanly (no panic, no partial metadata) when close proceeds.
4. **Abandoned `spawn_blocking` close** — confirm session-ID uniqueness
   (`create_timestamped*`) so a late close cannot hit a recreated record; if
   uniqueness is not guaranteed, key the late close by record generation.
5. **Windows process-group kill** — verify `kill_process_group_by_pid` /
   `kill_process_group` in `vtcode-bash-runner`; mark new reap tests'
   `#[cfg(unix)]` assumptions explicitly.
6. **Planning read-guard** — keep scoped block (no broad recovery); document the
   decision. Do not restore family-cap recovery.
7. **Registry-after-first-paint race** — audit `new_for_first_paint_with_loaded_config`
   vs early tool dispatch; report findings in the feature Report (no behavior
   change unless a concrete race is proven).

### Out of Scope

- Removing textual tool-call execution for gateway models (zai/glm).
- Changing skill location precedence or directory-name match policy.
- Raising `EXEC_SESSION_CLOSE_TIMEOUT` or redesigning PTY reap budgets.
- Full workspace suite beyond the changed crates.

## Tasks

- [x] T1: Unfenced-range + clean-name gate in `text_tools` (detect + strip) — acceptance: unit tests prove fenced markup is never a call; mid-prose `tool_call` mention is not a call; clean sole/preamble+call still parses (covers: S2.A)
- [x] T2: Native alias canonicalization + non-identifier rejection at dispatch — acceptance: native `bash` maps to `exec_command`; prose-named tool calls are rejected before registry (covers: S2.A)
- [x] T3: Recovery stays text when markup is not a clean call — acceptance: regression shows quoted/fenced markup in a recovery synthesis does not trip contract-violation/`Recovery synthesis failed` (covers: S2.B)
- [x] T4: Skill executor fence + clean-name + injection regression — acceptance: fenced/quoted markup not executed; out-of-scope denial still passes; `textual_skill_tool_call` tests green (covers: S2.C, S2.D.1-2)
- [ ] T5: `output_read_lock` close-race regression — acceptance: test proves lock-timeout close is clean (covers: S2.D.3)
- [x] T6: Session-ID uniqueness check for abandoned close (or generation key) — acceptance: evidence in Report or code change (covers: S2.D.4)
- [x] T7: Windows kill_process_group verification + platform marks on reap tests — acceptance: docs/tests state platform assumptions (covers: S2.D.5)
- [x] T8: Read-guard scoped-block decision recorded — acceptance: Report documents keep-as-is (covers: S2.D.6)
- [x] T9: Registry first-paint race audit — acceptance: Report states findings (covers: S2.D.7)
- [x] T10: Verify changed crates (fmt/check/nextest) — acceptance: commands exit 0 or failures marked PRE-EXISTING (covers: S2)
