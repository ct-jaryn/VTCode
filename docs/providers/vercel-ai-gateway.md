# Vercel AI Gateway Integration

The Vercel AI Gateway gives VT Code access to hundreds of models from OpenAI,
Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, Moonshot, Alibaba, MiniMax, Mistral, and others
behind a single OpenAI Chat Completions-compatible endpoint. A single API key
works across vendors with zero token markup and automatic failover.

## Setup

1. Create an API key in the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   under AI Gateway. See the official
   [getting started guide](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/getting-started).
2. Export it before starting VT Code:

   ```bash
   export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY="your-vercel-ai-gateway-key"
   ```

3. Select the provider in `vtcode.toml`:

   ```toml
   [agent]
   provider = "vercel"
   model = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5"
   api_key_env = "AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY"

   # Optional: make the endpoint and credential identity explicit
   [agent.provider_settings.vercel]
   name = "Vercel AI Gateway"
   base_url = "https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1"
   env_key = "AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY"
   ```

The default endpoint is:

```text
https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1
```

VT Code posts OpenAI Chat Completions requests to `/chat/completions`. Set
`VERCEL_AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` when a proxy is required.

## Quick start

```bash
export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY="your-vercel-ai-gateway-key"
vtcode --provider vercel --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-5 chat
```

You can also verify the endpoint directly with `curl`:

```bash
curl https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5",
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello!" }]
  }'
```

## Curated models

| Model ID | Display | Context | Input $/M | Output $/M | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` | Claude Sonnet 5 | 1,000,000 | $2 | $10 | Default |
| `anthropic/claude-opus-5` | Claude Opus 5 | 1,000,000 | $5 | $25 | |
| `anthropic/claude-opus-5-5` | Claude Opus 5.5 | 1,000,000 | $4 | $20 | Adaptive thinking always on, default effort medium |
| `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` | Claude Haiku 4.5 | 200,000 | $1 | $5 | |
| `openai/gpt-5.6-sol` | GPT-5.6 Sol | 1,050,000 | $2 | $10 | |
| `openai/gpt-6-astra` | GPT-6 Astra | 1,050,000 | $10 | $50 | |
| `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` | GPT-5.6 Luna | 1,050,000 | $0.20 | $1.20 | |
| `openai/gpt-5.3-codex` | GPT-5.3 Codex | 400,000 | $1.75 | $14 | |
| `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview | 1,000,000 | $2 | $12 | |
| `google/gemini-3.8-flash` | Gemini 3.8 Flash | 1,000,000 | $0.75 | $3.75 | |
| `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` | DeepSeek V4 Pro | 1,000,000 | $0.66 | $1.98 | |
| `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` | DeepSeek V4 Flash | 1,000,000 | $0.13 | $0.26 | |
| `moonshotai/kimi-k3` | Kimi K3 | 1,000,000 | $3 | $15 | |
| `moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code` | Kimi K2.7 Code | 256,000 | $0.95 | $4 | |
| `alibaba/qwen3.8-max` | Qwen3.8 Max | 1,000,000 | $2 | $6 | |
| `alibaba/qwen3-coder-next` | Qwen3 Coder Next | 256,000 | $0.50 | $1.20 | No reasoning traces |
| `minimax/minimax-m3` | MiniMax M3 | 512,000 | $0.30 | $1.20 | |

All curated models emit reasoning traces except
`alibaba/qwen3-coder-next`.

Model IDs use the gateway's native `vendor/model` format. Unlisted gateway
model IDs are accepted: VT Code validates the request shape only, not the
model allowlist.

## Persisting configuration

Add Vercel AI Gateway to your workspace `vtcode.toml`:

```toml
[agent]
provider = "vercel"
model = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5"
api_key_env = "AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY"
```

## Shared model IDs and provider precedence

Some curated IDs (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`, `openai/gpt-6-astra`,
`google/gemini-3.8-flash`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`,
`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, `moonshotai/kimi-k3`,
`moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code`) also exist in OpenRouter's catalog. When you
configure the model string directly, set `provider = "vercel"` explicitly —
bare model-string auto-detection keeps OpenRouter precedence for shared IDs.
Selecting a model from the `/model` picker always routes to Vercel.

## Runtime behaviour

- **API surface:** VT Code sends standard OpenAI Chat Completions requests to
  `POST /chat/completions`.
- **Tool calling:** Function calling uses the OpenAI-compatible format.
- **Streaming:** Streaming is fully supported.
- **Reasoning:** Reasoning traces are surfaced for all curated models except
  `alibaba/qwen3-coder-next`.
- **Structured output:** Supported.
- **Compaction:** `openai/*` routes compact via the gateway's native
  `POST /v1/responses/compact` endpoint; all other routes use VT Code's
  universal local summarization. See the [compaction engine guide](../development/compaction.md).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| `HTTP 401` errors | Confirm `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is set and points to a key created in the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard). |
| Requests hit the wrong endpoint | Set `VERCEL_AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` to override the base URL (for example, when routing through a proxy). |
| Model routes to OpenRouter instead of Vercel | Some model IDs are shared with OpenRouter's catalog; set `provider = "vercel"` explicitly in `vtcode.toml` or pick the model from the `/model` picker. |
| Model not found | Double-check the `vendor/model` ID in the [Vercel AI Gateway docs](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway). Unlisted gateway model IDs are accepted as long as the gateway serves them. |
