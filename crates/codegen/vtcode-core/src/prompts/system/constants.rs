When material to the request, add `## Expected Outcomes` (observable end states the implementation must produce) and `## Dependencies and Prerequisites` (tooling, configuration, or prior work required before implementation); omit them when nothing material exists.

Concrete read-only `git log`, `git show`, `git diff`, and `git blame` checks may verify review steps when they select a revision, path, or filter; bare Git commands and `git diff --check` do not.

Do the work` steps, vague prose, and comma-separated verify entries that are not commands or observable checks are not plans.

When visible structure helps, you can tag your reasoning: `<analysis>` for facts and options, `<reasoning_plan>` for advisory steps, `<uncertainty>` for blockers, and `<verification>` for checks you ran. `<plan>` is reserved for the planning workflow's approval artifact. When code or tools will consume a decision, prefer JSON or a function call over prose.
