# VT Code terminal profile icons

Bundled profile/tab icons sourced from `vtchat_resources/v2_1`.
Use the smallest icon that looks sharp; larger files are for app bundles only.

| File | Size | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vtcode-profile-32.png` | 32x32, 1.0K | Tab bar / low-DPI profile icon. Default choice for most terminals. |
| `vtcode-profile-120.png` | 120x120, 4.6K | HiDPI profile icon (iTerm2 Retina, Terminal.app). |
| `vtcode-profile-180.png` | 180x180, 7.5K | Cross-platform PNG fallback, incl. Windows Terminal `settings.json` `"icon"`. |
| `vtcode-profile-512.png` | 512x512, 29K | High-res / future app bundle only. Not for tabs. |
| `vtcode.svg` | vector, 474B | Scalable source. |

Artwork: yellow `V` mark sourced from `vtchat_resources/v2_1/logo_dark.png`
(`logo_light.png` is byte-identical), downscaled per size.

## Runtime behavior

VT Code sets both the terminal icon label (`OSC 1`) and window title
(`OSC 2`) to the same sanitized status text on every title update. This
keeps the built-in profile/tab icon label in sync on emulators that
distinguish icon from title, instead of relying on `OSC 0` aliasing.

## Manual graphical icon setup

Text `OSC 1`/`OSC 2` works everywhere. For a graphical icon, configure
once per terminal:

- iTerm2 (automatic): run `/terminal-setup install-iterm2-icon` inside
  VT Code — or just launch VT Code under iTerm2, which installs the
  profile on first run and prints a notice. It installs a `VT Code`
  dynamic profile (custom icon) under
  `~/Library/Application Support/iTerm2/DynamicProfiles/vtcode.json`
  with artwork in the VT Code data dir. New tabs pick it up immediately.
  The installer also runs on every interactive iTerm2 launch and rewrites
  the profile file whenever it is missing or the bundled profile/artwork
  changed, so deleting `vtcode.json` is not a persistent opt-out — it
  reappears on the next launch (there is no config key to disable this;
  `--quiet` suppresses only the install notice). VT Code switches the
  session to the profile once at TUI startup, only when the file exists,
  and switches back to the session's original profile on exit — so the
  icon is shown only while the TUI runs. If a tab is already stuck showing
  the icon from an older build, run `/terminal-setup reset-iterm2-icon`
  in it or open a new tab.
- iTerm2 (manual): Settings > Profiles > General > Icon, choose
  `vtcode-profile-120.png` (Retina) or `vtcode-profile-32.png`.
- Windows Terminal: set the profile `"icon"` to
  `resources/icons/vtcode-profile-180.png`.
- VS Code / Zed / Warp: these use theme/picker icons, not image files;
  keep the runtime `OSC 1`/`OSC 2` label and optionally reference
  `vtcode.svg` in docs.
- Kitty / Ghostty / WezTerm / Alacritty / Terminal.app / Hyper / Tabby:
  window icons come from the OS app bundle; no per-profile image needed.
  The runtime icon label still applies to tabs and taskbars.
