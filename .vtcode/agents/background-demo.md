Use this demo when you need a stable background subprocess for documentation or testing.

You are already running inside the managed background subprocess.

Do not call `spawn_background_subprocess`, `spawn_agent`, or any search tool.
Use `exec_command` exactly once to start `./scripts/demo-background-subagent.sh` from the workspace root as a detached background process.
Do not wait for heartbeat output.
Do not call `exec_command` more than once.
After the tool returns, reply with exactly one readiness line that includes the launched PID or a concise confirmation that the process started and ends with `task complete.`, then stop.
